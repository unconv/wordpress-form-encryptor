# WordPress Form Encryption Plugin

This plugin was made for my YouTube video about using ChatGPT to build a WordPress plugin. It encrypts selected fields in contact forms before storing them in the database or sending them in emails. The encrypted messages can be decrypted using a private key.

**This plugin is not production-ready.**

Feel free to improve the code and make a pull request with your improvements!

The plugin works with Ninja Forms, WPForms and Contact Form 7.

Form fields are encrypted based on a list of field names in the plugin settings which can be found in the administration area left hand side menu.
